# Usable Security and Privacy Project
The current crypto wallets have several drawbacks and limitations. And people are finding it difficult to adapt to these despite various changes and updates brought about by wallet designers. Meanwhile, people find it familiar and easy to do UPI transactions using QR codes and expect something similar along these lines. So by this study, we want to answer the question ’Can we design a novel usable crypto wallet interface in line with users’ usual financial experiences and familiar bank payment interfaces’.

This website is the prototype we developed to help conduct our survey.
